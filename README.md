### Project Description

Initially, I constructed this web application to persist data through cookies in the user session. 
After achieving functionality, I then refactored the code to persist data through a PostgreSQL database. 
Finally, I added JavaScript/jQuery functionality that has a user confirm deletion of an item with a dialog box.
